Learn to insert math formula on Word, but there are some things wrong, should I learning MathJax that I use on my blog too?

<!--more-->

Word always use __space__ key to apply.    
MathJax use `$your formula here$`


Formula|Word|MathJax
------|:--:|:--:
$5\over2$|5/2|5\over2
$\mu$|\mu|\mu
$2^5$|2^5|2^5
